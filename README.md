```
평온함을 rip, 대혼란을 일으켜
본 적 없던 lit, 내 본능을 깨워
Going to my head,
going all out of control
'Cause I shine so bright
like dynamite gold
Yeah
ITZY
Yeah
Ooh
쉴 새 없는 하루 Wait a minute,
문젠 없지 Wait a minute
좀 더 재밌는 걸 찾아갈 뿐이지
What
Just keep it going up
Up, up, up, up
그때 너를 발견한 거야
두 눈이 마주친 다음
That thing that you do
That thing that you do,
불현듯이 내맘이
Yeah, diamond in my heart
반쯤 홀린 듯
What's the deal?
Always in my head,
you a repeat of my favorite song
나의 머리엔 새로운
감정들이 느껴져
완전히 다른 세상이 all around
Get up, let's go another round
It's like gold
눈을 뗄 수 없이 glow
Day and night, we beaming,
blazing just like that
Day and night, we beaming,
blazing just like that
It's like gold
거부할 수 없이 glow
Day and night, we beaming,
blazing just like that
Head to toe, we're G-O-L-D,
GOLD
Gold in the air, gold everywhere
디딜 틈조차 없는 shadow
너라는 존재로
Hey, 나는 이제 저 멀리 빛나는
별보다 밝게 타오르게 돼
What you want to do?
What you want to do?
조금 위험한 느낌, ooh
Yeah, diamond in my heart,
가빠지는 숨
What's the dеal?
Always in my head,
you a repeat of my favorite song
나의 심장에 낯선 감정들이 느껴져
완전히 다른 세상이 all around
Get up, let's go another round
It's like gold
눈을 뗄 수 없이 glow
Day and night, we beaming,
blazing just like that
Day and night, we beaming,
blazing just like that
It's like gold
거부할 수 없이 glow
Day and night we beaming
blazing just like that
Head to toe, we're G-O-L-D,
GOLD
Yeah
It's like, it's like,
it's like, it's like gold
계속 날 이끄는 glow
Day and night, we beaming,
blazing just like that
Day and night, we beaming,
blazing just like that
It's like gold
눈을 감아봐도 glow
Day and night, we beaming,
blazing just like that
Head to toe, we're G-O-L-D,
GOLD
